# 1D-Adder-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This project implements the AdderNet (Adder Convolutional Neural Network) mentioned in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13200.pdf but for 1D sequence processing. Original pytorch implementation of the AdderNet can be found in https://github.com/huawei-noah/AdderNet/. 

The code is adapted to perform 1D additions-based convolutions on a 1D data, i.e. time-series.
